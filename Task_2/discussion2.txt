1. We started by creating tables for our entities and relationships from database schema.
2. We created dummy data for testing.
3. We created helper views to help us create neccessary views regarding requirements for graduation. 
4. When we needed to find out if a student has passed the requirements to graduate then we used the FUNCTION CheckGraduation.
	- For this part we got an error when making a call to the function CheckGraduation. With more detailed inspection we found out that the
	- syntax for the function parameter was wrong. However, after endless tries we were not able to get to work correctly, we tried to do as the
	- slides describe but always got an error.
